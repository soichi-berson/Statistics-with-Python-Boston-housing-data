# 🏠 Boston Housing Data Analysis  
**Statistics for Data Science with Python – Coursera Final Project**

## 📌 Overview

In this project, I analysed the Boston Housing dataset (U.S. Census Service) as a Data Scientist for a housing agency.  
The goal was to apply statistical methods and visualisation techniques to generate actionable insights for management.

Key questions explored:

- Does proximity to the Charles River affect house prices?
- How do housing values vary by property age?
- Is there a relationship between pollution (NOX) and industrial land use (INDUS)?
- Does distance to employment centres (DIS) impact housing value?

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates  
- Generated correlation matrix  
- Produced descriptive statistics  
- Created visualisations:
  - Boxplot (MEDV)
  - Bar plot (CHAS)
  - MEDV vs AGE groups
  - Scatter plot (NOX vs INDUS)
  - Histogram (PTRATIO)

## 📊 Statistical Analysis

- **Levene’s Test** – Variance comparison (CHAS groups)  
- **Independent T-Test** – MEDV difference by Charles River proximity  
- **ANOVA** – MEDV comparison across AGE groups  
- **Pearson Correlation** – Relationship between NOX and INDUS  
- **Linear Regression** – Impact of DIS on MEDV

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Homes near the Charles River have significantly higher median values.  
- Older housing stock shows variation in price levels.  
- Industrial land use is strongly associated with higher NOX levels.  
- Distance to employment centres significantly influences housing prices.
